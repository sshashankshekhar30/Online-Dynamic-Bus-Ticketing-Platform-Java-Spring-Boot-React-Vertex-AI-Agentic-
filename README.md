How to use AWS/GCP to build AI Agentic based Web apps using Java and Spring boot technologies?
ChatGPT said:
You can absolutely combine AWS/GCP with Java + Spring Boot to build AI Agentic-based web apps — the process just requires stitching together cloud services, AI frameworks, and orchestration logic.

Here’s a clear step-by-step roadmap for you:

1️⃣ Understand the Core Stack
We’re dealing with three pillars:

Layer	Technology	Purpose
Backend	Java + Spring Boot	Your main business logic, APIs, user auth, agent orchestration control
Cloud Platform	AWS or GCP	AI model hosting, scalable compute, storage, networking, event triggers
AI/Agentic Framework	LangChain4j, OpenAI API, HuggingFace, GCP Vertex AI Agents	Handles reasoning, decision-making, task automation
2️⃣ Choose Your Cloud AI Stack
Both AWS & GCP give you building blocks for agentic AI:

On AWS
Amazon Bedrock → Direct access to foundation models (Claude, LLaMA, Titan, etc.)

Amazon SageMaker → Train/deploy custom models, integrate with Spring Boot via REST/gRPC

AWS Lambda → Event-driven AI tasks (agents triggered by actions)

Amazon DynamoDB / RDS → Store memory/state for agents

Amazon API Gateway → Expose Spring Boot APIs

On GCP
Vertex AI Agents → Native agent orchestration + multi-model reasoning

Vertex AI Studio → Prompt design, tuning

Cloud Run / GKE → Deploy your Spring Boot backend

Firestore / Cloud SQL → Agent memory persistence

Pub/Sub → Event-driven agent triggers

3️⃣ The Agentic Web App Architecture
A high-level workflow:

[User Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS/Vue/React]
         |
     API Requests
         |
[Spring Boot Backend (Java)]
         |
   Agent Orchestration Layer
         |
   Cloud AI Service (AWS Bedrock / GCP Vertex AI)
         |
   Data Sources / Tools
(Database, APIs, Web Crawlers, Cloud Storage)
Frontend: Basic HTML/CSS/JS or Vue/React SPA

Spring Boot: REST controllers handle requests, invoke AI agents, manage memory

Agent Layer: Using LangChain4j or your own orchestration logic

Cloud AI Service: Provides reasoning, planning, multi-step decision-making

Memory & State: Stored in Redis, DynamoDB, Firestore, or PostgreSQL

Tool Integration: Web scraping, APIs, DB queries, emails, file handling

4️⃣ How to Connect Java + Spring Boot with AI Agents
You can use:

LangChain4j
Java wrapper for agentic AI patterns:

AiService aiService = AiServices.create(AiInterface.class, OpenAiChatModel.withApiKey("YOUR_KEY"));

String result = aiService.chat("Find latest stock prices and analyze trends.");
System.out.println(result);
Integrates with OpenAI, HuggingFace, Bedrock, Vertex AI

Allows tools/functions so your AI can call APIs, DBs, or custom code

5️⃣ Implementing Agentic Logic
Your agent will:

Receive user request

Break it into sub-tasks

Call different services/tools

Store results in memory

Return structured output

Example use case:
"Build me a travel itinerary"

Step 1: Parse location & dates

Step 2: Search hotels via API

Step 3: Fetch weather

Step 4: Combine results & optimize plan

Step 5: Return to frontend

6️⃣ Deployment on AWS/GCP
Option 1: AWS
Package Spring Boot as a Docker image

Push to ECR (Elastic Container Registry)

Deploy via ECS (Fargate) or Elastic Beanstalk

Use Bedrock API for AI calls

Option 2: GCP
Package Spring Boot JAR or Docker image

Deploy on Cloud Run (serverless) or GKE

Integrate with Vertex AI Agents for AI orchestration

7️⃣ Extra Features for Agentic Power
Memory → Store conversation context in DynamoDB / Firestore

Tool Use → Let agent call APIs, DB queries, emails

Multi-Agent Systems → Multiple specialized agents working together (researcher, summarizer, planner)

Event-driven triggers → Pub/Sub (GCP) or EventBridge (AWS)

✅ End Result:
You’ll have a Java + Spring Boot backend running in the cloud, connected to Agentic AI services for intelligent, autonomous task execution, accessible via a web interface.

If you want, I can make you a full AWS + GCP deployment diagram for a Java Spring Boot Agentic AI web app so you can see exactly how services connect.
Do you want me to prepare that architecture diagram for you?

Bus Ticketing Platform Spring Boot Vertex Ai


Online Dynamic Bus Ticketing Platform — Java Spring Boot + React + Vertex AI (Agentic)
This repository-style document contains a full-stack starter implementation for a dynamic online bus ticketing platform integrated with Google Vertex AI Agents. It is intended as a working prototype and learning scaffold — you'll need to configure Google Cloud credentials, a MySQL instance, and adjust production settings before deploying.

What this package includes (high-level)

Spring Boot REST backend (Java, Spring Data JPA, MySQL)

Agent integration service (calling Vertex AI Agent Engine / REST endpoints)

Entities: User, Bus, Trip, Booking

Repositories, Services, Controllers (authentication simplified for prototype)

React + Bootstrap + FontAwesome frontend (search, book, manage bookings)

Example Dockerfiles & SQL schema

Quick setup notes (before running)
Create a Google Cloud project and enable Vertex AI, IAM, and any other required APIs.

Create a service account with roles/aiplatform.user (and other access as needed), download the JSON key and set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS env var for the backend.

Create a MySQL database and update application.properties.

From Vertex AI: create an Agent or use an Agent Engine session. You can call Agent Engine REST endpoints to create sessions and send messages (the backend includes a simple REST-based helper).
